# Travel App

## Overview

This app takes in a user's travel destination and departure/return dates in order to return trip information, weather at destination, and a photo of the destination.  To do this, it uses three APIS: Geonames, to obtain location (latitide/longitude); Weatherbit, to obtain weather information; and Pixabay, to obtain pictures.

Information relayed back to the user includes:
  - departure date
  - return date
  - days until departure
  - trip duration
  - country
  - temperature at destination
  - general forecast at destination
  - chance of precipitation
  - high temperature
  - low temperature

## Running the App

### Run in Development Mode

## Extending the Project

Added functionality:
